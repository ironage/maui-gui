Velocity Items TODO:
- Data to Process pane:
	-Plus to add button
	-list items can be reordered
	-scroll after ~5 items
	-color on proceess (orange to green - current progress?)
	-ignore frame clipping on multiple videos
	-pixel calibration and ROI are same for multiple videos
	-subtract sub button to remove a video (right)
- Output pane: (check mac for notes on this)
	- Choose output directory
	- Process output video option
- Wall Detection:
	- Checkmark can turn on and off roi/scale
	- adjustable number of ROI points, (try wide transparency region, larger dots)
- Velocity Detection:
	- Checkmark can turn on and off roi/scale
	- blue velocity scale and roi
- Please reference MAUI... with Icon
- Integrate MATLAB via API with Ahmed for processing steps
- Bump to v4, separate installer for trials
