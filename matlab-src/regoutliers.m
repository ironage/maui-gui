function [X,Y,rSquares,outliers_idx] = regoutliers(X0,Y0,noutliers,plotOp)

% Summary: Removes outliers from both variables of bivariate linear 
% regression based on regression residuals.
% 
% Function Description:
% This function accepts two (vector of) variables for which a bivariate
% linear regression analysis is meant to be performed, and removes the
% outliers from both variables. Since the regression residual vector is
% used to detect the outliers, only those records which stand farthest from
% the 1:1 regression line will be detected and removed. If more than one
% outliers is asked to be removed, before removing the next outlier,
% regression residuals will be recalculated to avoid swamping and masking
% effects, then the next farthest point from 1:1 line will be removed and
% so forth. This method differentiates those points that might be outlier
% in a single variable (X or Y) but can fit well in a 1:1 regression
% line-fit from those points that stay in the acceptable range in each of
% the individual input variables (X,Y) but can appear in the outliers when
% the two variables are fitted in the regression line. To detect the
% outlier from the residual's vector, a subfunction is used (this
% subfunction is an enhancement from a work by Vince Petaccio, 2009, and is
% available also as a stand-alone function, "outliers", from Matlab File
% exchange).
%
% --Inputs:
%   X0: vector of dependent variable in bivariate linear regression
%   Y0: vector of independent variable in bivariate linear regression 
%   noutliers: how many outliers should be removed? (1 will be used as
%   default if not provided)
%   plotOp: plotting option, whether to produce a scatterplot of the two
%   input variables before and after each iteration of outliers removal (up
%   to noutliers) or only do calculations (0: don't plot, 1: plot), if 1 is
%   given, plots will be generated in a subplot 
%
% --Outputs:
%   X: vector of dependent variable after removal of the outliers
%   Y: vector of independent variable after removal of the outliers
%   rSquares: a vector of r-square values calculated from the original
%   inputs and after removal of each outlier
%   outliers_idx: indexes of outliers, note that records for these indexes
%   are turned to NaN in X and Y outputs
%
% --Dependency:
%   outliers subfunction, which is included in this code following main 
%   function
%
% --Example:
% X0=10.2:0.2:30; %first vector
% Y0=0.1:0.1:10;  %second vector
% idx=randi(length(Y0),4,1);     %randomly distribute 4 noise
% Y0(idx)=randn(4,1)*10; %produce 4 random noise 
% noutliers=3;    %number of outliers to remove
% plotOp=1;       %0: dont plot, 1: plot
% [X,Y,rSquares,outliers_idx] = regoutliers(X0,Y0,noutliers,plotOp);
% rSquares %print rsquare values calculated from original data and each
% step after removal of outliers, this should show progressively increasing
% values, otherwise number of outliers to be removed should be decreased
% or in some cases increased.
% outliers_idx %print indexes of outlier records in both input vectors

%% outliers function: remove outliers based on Thompson Tau:
function [X, outliers_idx] = outliers(X0, num_outliers)

% --Summary: outliers are detected using Thompson Tau method and turned to 
% NaN in the output.
%
% --Function Decription: 
% This function accepts a vector and detects the outlier values in the
% vector using Thopson Tau method, which is based on the absolute deviation 
% of each record from the mean of the entire vector, and fills the outliers
% with NaNs in the returned output. The magnitude of Thompson's Tau value 
% corresponding to the number of records in the input vector to the 
% Standard Deviation of the input vector is the rule to decide if any 
% record in in the outlier. The mean, standard deviation (std) and the 
% magnitude of Thompson's Tau (tau*std) are calculated again after removal 
% of each outlier.  
%
% --Inputs:
%   X0: input vector which contains outleirs
%   num_outliers: number of the outliers that should be removed from the
%   input vector
%   
% --Outputs:
%   X: output vector with outliers (if any detected) turned to NaN 
%   outliers_idx: the index(es) of any detected outliers, the more extreme 
%   outliers will be detected first, so the first index refers to the 
%   most extreme outlier and so forth
%
% --Theory of Thompson Tau method: 
%   http://www.mne.psu.edu/me345/Lectures/Outliers.pdf
%   http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345543 (Thompson, 1985)
%
% --Note: this function is an improvement based on Vince Petaccio, 2009:
% http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24885-remove-outliers
% --Improvements: 
%  1. Handleing NaNs in inputs
%  2. Number of outliers to be removed is restricted to a user defined
%  maximum to avoid uncontrolled shrinking of input dataset
%  3. Filling outliers by NaNs to preserve original dimensions of the input 
%  vector; this is crucial when the input variable is supposed to be used
%  with another variable with the same size (e.g., for plotting, regression
%  calculations, etc.)
%  4. Indexes of the outliers that have been detected and removed are
%  returned so that the user knows which records have been removed. 
%  5. Syntax and algorithm has been siginificantly improved, this includes
%  the logic for detection of the outliers from the upper and lower limits.
%  Logic to detect an outlier is solely based on the absolute distance of
%  each record from the central point rather than detecting the outliers
%  sequentially, which was the case in Vince Petaccio, 2009, where the
%  outliers were detected and removed by order of one from the upper and
%  the next from the lower extremes. This code first arranges the extreme
%  values (upper or lower) to one side of the sorted vector based on the
%  absolute distance from the center while preserving the original
%  arrangment in the input vector. Later, the code removes the farthest
%  point from the central value and continues to do that until
%  num_outliers is reached.
% 
% --Example:
% X0=[2.0, 3.0, -50.5, 4.0, 109.0, 6.0]
% [X, outliers_idx] = outliers(X0, 2)
%
% see also: outliers (works on both vector and matrix).

%Sort the input data vector so that removing the extreme values becomes an 
%arbitrary task, using absolute value of the vector will pile the extremes
%to the upper side of the vector (at first only indexes are required), also
