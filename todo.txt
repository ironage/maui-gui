Priority Bugs for 30 July 2016
- When I hit the pause button and move the ROI AND change the size of the ROI, and then hit play again, it doesn't adjust properly.
- When I am in ROI mode, and I resize the window of the program, it goes all wacky.  The ROI window doesn't seem to call the autoInitialize function at all.
- call autoinitialize when frame changes in ROI mode.
- Please continue to show the ROI box during processing.
- init matlab immediately on background thread
- load 2nd video

Changes in next release: 
- logging for last frame
- change video progress indexing to start at 1 and not 0
- video finish signal passed to UI, start button resets
- pause works correctly (continue/pause)
- handle decimal values in scale conversion properly (previously would round to integers)
- fixed rounding error in pixel conversions in results csv file
- scale defaults to 1 cm
- log "NaN" if no measurement is found
- allow users to choose output directory (default to input directory)
- allow users to choose output file name (default to input file name + suffix)
- if the csv file already exists, append the timestamp to avoid overwriting output data
- fix video output format, if input video didn't have format set properly. (Jason please verify this works on your machine)

For Ahmed (MATLAB side):
- the autoInit function doesn't return any values if the ROI has a width which is an odd number
- crash in matlab update function if top or bottom strong points are empty (should return zeros)


Future tasks:
-reset button
-open image for one frame processing
-batch image processing
-output csv data
