Priority Bugs for 30 July 2016
-log last frame
-Also, in the summary panel (top left), your frame indexing is off by one.  The first frame number should be 1, not zero, since it is the "first" frame.
- if the ROI expander isn't opened before pressing play the program crashes. It is because I pass an empty array to matlab setup function
-test what kind of video files are supported (changed output file type?)
- When I hit the pause button and move the ROI AND change the size of the ROI, and then hit play again, it doesn't adjust properly.
- When I am in ROI mode, and I resize the window of the program, it goes all wacky.  The ROI window doesn't seem to call the autoInitialize function at all.
- The default measurement should be 1 cm for "Step 2: Calibration"
- We need to have a save button so the user can select where to save the output.
- The default location of the output AVI and CSV should be in the same folder as the original video.
- The output file names should be:
    originalName_tracking.AVI
    originalName_data.CSV
- Please continue to show the ROI box during processing.
- When I run "maui-gui.exe" I get many videos, all with size 0 KB, in the output folder.
Inline image 1  (see: google drive/Hedgehog Medical/GUI library files/Jason/video010.AVI)
- The OLD, top IMT and bottom IMT (cm/mm) all show up as zero in the CSV.
- If there is no measurement returned, then we need to write "NaN" to the CSV file.
