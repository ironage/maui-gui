TODO: 

- Investigate a bug with “bmp” image inputs not generating any output.
- Add baseline bmp and png images to tests.
- Feature request for output to image format instead of assuming “avi”; add an option for “png” which will output a series of images.
- Make sure that statistics are sent when software is closed else they'll be lost.
- Upgrade server Django version to something more secure. Requires Apache config.
- upgrade opencv to get performance enhancements

-zoom
-zoom on mouse scroll? or advance video progress?
-checkmark icons for settings progress
-settings, color chooser
-help / about
-write log files to disk


DONE:
- Organize Admin view of statistics by user and date.
- Text of combined velocity and diameter statistic is "unknown 3"
- Investigate potential regression in 4.7 vs 4.8, I can do this if someone wants to send the input image where this was noticed.


Velocity Items TODO:
- Data to Process pane:
	-Plus to add button
	-scroll after ~5 items
	-color on proceess (orange to green - current progress?)
	-ignore frame clipping on multiple videos
	-pixel calibration and ROI are same for multiple videos
	-subtract sub button to remove a video (right)
- Output pane: (check mac for notes on this)
	- Choose output directory
	- Process output video option
- Wall Detection:
	- Checkmark can turn on and off roi/scale
	- adjustable number of ROI points, (try wide transparency region, larger dots)
- Velocity Detection:
	- Checkmark can turn on and off roi/scale
	- blue velocity scale and roi
- Please reference MAUI... with Icon
- Integrate MATLAB via API with Ahmed for processing steps
- Bump to v4, separate installer for trials


Won't Fix:
-list items can be reordered



Changes in the next release: v3.2
- preview results of past processing when seeking back to old frames (on pause and after finished)
- fixed video output issue (it was always appending frames even if they were reprocessed)
- checkbox for making video output optional
- cancelable dialog shows video output progress
- disabled bottom video controls while processing
- triangle handle for seeking video control
- allow mouse scroll on video control bar for seeking
- open roi adjustment panel automatically on pause
- fixed frame advancing by one after pause and finish

Changes in the next release: v3.1
- Change window title to "Measurements from Arterial Ultrasound Imaging (MAUI)"
- Changed output CSV: OLD to media-media, ILT to intima-intima, IMT to intima-media
- Added 64 bit visual studio libraries to install (msvcp120.dll, msvcpr120.dll, vccorlib120.dll)
- Support loading videos from network drive

Changes in next release: v3
- Fixed a race condition which could cause crashes when opening a video.
- Log data overwrites previous results if user pauses and rewinds and plays again.
- Start and end positions of the video control bar reset when opening a new video.
- Persist the default name in the output name box for quick editing.
- Remember input and output directories, even across quit/reopen.
- Add single axis handles for ROI adjustments.
- Added a version string in the bottom left corner, and added to output csv file.
- Added ILT calculation to the output CSV.

For Ahmed (MATLAB side):
