Feedback From Jason 4 Aug 2016
- Calibration remove explicit calculations
- resize window on processing roi malfunction
- roi update when frame changes
- end frame not set before start frame

Priority Bugs for 30 July 2016
- When I am in ROI mode, and I resize the window of the program, it goes all wacky.  The ROI window doesn't seem to call the autoInitialize function at all.
- call autoinitialize when frame changes in ROI mode?

Changes in next release: 
- Custom popup dialog box with no help button in title bar.

For Ahmed (MATLAB side):
- The autoInit function doesn't seem to return any values if the ROI has a width which is an odd number?
- Crash in matlab update function if top or bottom strong points are empty (should return zeros)
- Can we combine the two library files into one? I think it will take less time to initialize this way.

Future tasks:
-reset button
-open image for one frame processing
-batch image processing
-output csv data
